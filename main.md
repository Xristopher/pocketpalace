##Palatin's Personal Pocket Palace

_Type_: Ritual
_Time_: 60 days
_Components_: VSM (including 25,000gp in rare components; actual items will vary by makeup/design of the palace)

This creates a stable, permanent stronghold in a pocket dimension. It is accessible only to its creator and individuals that they select. At casting, or at a later time, the caster may also create an item of ownership that conveys to its bearer some of the abilities that the caster has with regards to the Palace.

A creature exiting the main door of the palace will instantly be transported to the location that the spell was originally cast, but only the caster and designated occupants may re-enter.
