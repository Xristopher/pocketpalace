* _Components_: VSM (including 25,000gp in rare components; actual items will vary by makeup/design of the palace)

## Description
This creates a stable, permanent stronghold in a pocket dimension. It is accessible only to its creator and individuals that they select. At casting, or at a later time, the caster may also create an item of ownership that conveys to its bearer some of the abilities that the caster has with regards to the Palace.

A creature exiting the main door of the palace will instantly be transported to the current location of the exit door. This is originally the location where the door was cast, but the door may be moved. Only the caster, the bearer of the Ownership Token and accompaning guests may re-enter.

The total size of the palace may not exceed 5000 sq. ft.

### Ownership Token
At the time of casting, or by re-casting the spell (minus the 25,000gp components and it only takes 8 hours) you may create an item that attuned to the palace. This can take any form of any small item such as a key, ring, a necklace or similar item that can fit in a pocket and weights no more than xx oz.

This token conveys the following ownership benefits to anyone who possesses the item and speaks the command word:
* Re-entry to the palace through the front door.
* The bearer of the token, and up to 8 others may transport to the palace, per the timing and methods described above,
* Once every 10 days, the bearer may redesign the palace by performing one of the following:
  * adding or removing one room and an attached cooridor,
  * changing the interior design of one room,
  * modyfying the arrangement of the existing rooms and cooridors.
  * move the location of the exit door to a known location. This is done from within the palace and takes 1d6 hours to accomplish. When attempting to move the door, you must make a WIS ST. The base DC is 14, with the following modifications:
    * +3 if the door is being moved across planes.
    * +5 if you have never seen the location in person.
    * -1 if the new location is well known to you.
    * -1 if the new locaiton is connected to you in some way (lived there for more than 1 year, throughly researched, etc.)
    * -2 if an ally is at that location and some form of communication exists between you and that ally.
